# Python Programming - Project 1 [40 marks]

Your tasks are in the notebook `project-1.ipynb`. Please read the guidance below carefully.

---

### Presentation, plots, and code comments

- Your code should be **well-commented**, with a comment explaining each step of your code. All your functions should have **docstrings**. This is not only good practice -- it is also essential for us to assess your understanding of the code you have written.
- Your code should have good **readability** and sensible **structure**. See the Week 3 workshop activity for reference, as well as the CR tasks.
- Your code must generate and display all relevant output when run. Rerun your code cells after editing your code, to make sure that the output is updated.

**Up to half** of the marks for a given question may be deducted for missing, incomplete, or inaccurate code comments, poor code structure or readability, or poorly presented plots.

### Working on your project with git and GitHub

- While working on the project, **commit and push your changes often** -- every time you make progress on a subtask. If you tend to forget to do this regularly, you could e.g. set a timer to remind you to commit every hour or so. This ensures that
    - you won't have any last-minute technical issues when it comes to submitting, and
    - your progress is **backed up** on GitHub, and not just inside a temporary codespace.
- You will submit the assignment through **Gradescope**, by providing a link to your GitHub repository. You can resubmit to Gradescope as many times as you want before the deadline. (More detailed submission instructions will be available shortly.)

### Academic integrity

This is an **individual** assignment -- the work your submit must be your own, to reflect and assess your own understanding and knowledge.

#### Collaboration vs. collusion

Collaboration is fine, but collusion is not. Concretely, this means that discussing the assignment **in broad terms** with others students is fine (and encouraged), as well as giving each other hints or general advice on how to approach a problem. You can use Piazza for this, for example -- if you are stuck, then please ask for help!

However, you are **not permitted** to share your working (even partially) with other students -- that includes your code, any detailed description or explanation of code, and any results or analysis you perform.

For example:

- Alice and Bob are discussing the assignment in the library. Bob's code is not working for one of the questions, and he can't figure out why. He asks Alice how she's tackled the problem, and she explains her approach in broad terms. This gives Bob an idea, and he tries it later. *This is all fine.*
- Bob's idea doesn't work out, and he shares his screen with Alice to show his code. *This is getting dangerous* -- here's why:
    - Alice helps him with understanding the error, and gives him some pointers and ideas to try, without explaining the problem or the solution in much detail. *That would still be fine.*
    - Alice is stuck on the next question, though, and spots a couple of lines of Bob's code at the bottom of the screen. She uses some of that code for the next question in her submission. This is not OK: *both Bob and Alice have now committed misconduct* -- Alice by using Bob's code, and Bob by sharing his screen.
- Bob is still stuck. He posts his code for that question on Piazza. Some students help and also give him some general advice. Charlie sees the post on Piazza, and didn't know how to start that question. Charlie uses some of Bob's code, with some corrections to fix the problems, and submits it for the assignment. *This is also misconduct* by both Bob and Charlie.
- Bob is still stuck (poor Bob!). It's getting very close to the deadline now, so he asks his friend Dara to *pleaaaase* show their solution, he promises not to copy it. Bob and Dara are really good friends, so Dara finds it difficult to refuse and sends their code. Bob rewrites Dara's code by changing some variable names, rearranging a bit, and paraphrasing the code comments so that they are "in his own words". *This is misconduct* by both Bob and Dara.

Use and trust your own judgement. It's important to understand that even with the best intentions, you expose yourself to academic misconduct as soon as you show your code to another student, and this could have very serious consequences.

#### Providing references

For every separate question, **most** of the code you submit must be **authored by you**. That being said, you may use any code from the course material (e.g. workshop tasks, tutorial sheets, videos), without citing it.

You may also use **small pieces of code** (a few lines max at a time) that you found elsewhere -- e.g. examples from the documentation, a textbook, forums, blogs, etc... You may use this code *verbatim* (i.e. almost exactly as you found it), or adapt it to write your own solution. Again, the large majority of the code must be written by you, so use this sparingly.

A programming assignment is just like any other academic assignment -- and therefore, **you must provide a citation for any such code**, whether you use it *verbatim* or adapt it. To do so, include a code comment at the start of your script or notebook cell, indicating:

- the line numbers where the code was used or adapted,
- the URL of the source (or, if it's from a book, a full reference to the book),
- the date you accessed the source,
- the author of the code (if the information is available). *This includes cases where the "author" is a generative AI.*

You can use this template -- delete one of the URL or book reference lines as appropriate:

```python
# Lines X-Y: Author Name
# URL: http://...
# Book Title, year published, page number.
# Accessed on 31 Sep 2023.
```

You must also provide **detailed code comments** for any such code, in your own words, to demonstrate that you fully understand how it works -- you will lose marks if you use external code without explaining it, even if it's cited correctly.

Remember to exercise caution if you use any code from external sources -- there are a lot of blogs and forums out there with very bad code!

With all that, we trust that you'll be able to use your best judgement, and to cite your sources appropriately -- if anything is not clear, please do ask. Note that **all submissions** will be automatically checked (and manually reviewed) for plagiarism and collusion, and [the University's academic misconduct policy](https://www.ed.ac.uk/academic-services/staff/discipline/academic-misconduct) applies.
