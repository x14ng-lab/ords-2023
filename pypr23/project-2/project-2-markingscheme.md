# Project 2 marking scheme

The mark for the project is divided into 4 criteria. The total mark is **40 marks**.

### Group work

There are groups of 3 to 5 students. The expected amount of work should be commensurate with the difference in group size. The standard/quality of work should be at the same level regardless of group size.

Groups are required to work together to produce a single cohesive report. If the report is clearly very disjointed (e.g. it is clear that students have worked mostly on their own and put together the work at the last minute in the same file), a penalty may be applied in C3. Please note that "cohesive" doesn't necessarily mean that students should collaborate on every single question; but there should be some evidence of a substantial amount of collaboration and discussion between the group members. For instance, very noticeable differences in presentation, code style, commenting, etc. between different parts is probably a good indicator that very little collaboration has occurred, particularly when putting the final report together.

## Criteria

#### C1: 16 marks - Technical proficiency

- **13-16**: All or almost all of the code runs with no errors, and correctly produces the expected output, except perhaps for a very small number of minor issues/miscalculations (incorrect results). The implementation is well-structured and sensible, with deliberate efforts to keep the code concise and efficient. There is very little to no redundant or unnecessary code.
- **8-12**: All or most of the code runs with very few to no errors and mostly produces the expected output, but perhaps there are more minor issues/miscalculations, or a few more important issues. The implementation is mostly well-structured (at least for the large majority of the submission), but perhaps there was less of an attempt to keep it concise or efficient.
- **4-7**: Most of the code runs but there are some errors or significant problems or incorrect results. There are some significant issues with code structure and logic, perhaps not all code-breaking, but which could demonstrate a poor understanding of some programming concepts. There was very little or no attempt to keep the code efficient and concise. Alternatively, perhaps there is just very little code to go by (commensurate with group size).
- **<4**: Generally poor attempt, without much evidence of understanding of most of the course material. There are many bugs and problems with the code which should have been found easily.

#### C2: 12 marks - Amount of work done and depth of investigation

- **10-12**: The report addresses a good number of interesting/non-trivial aspects of the dataset, and investigates them in depth. There is significant and creative additional investigation of the dataset, beyond the suggested questions, which possibly makes appropriate use of other data when relevant; or perhaps some of the suggested questions were investigated at a significantly deeper level than the basic premise. The results are pertinent to the questions, and provide valuable insights into the data; conclusions are drawn accurately.
- **7-9**: The report addresses some interesting questions, most of which are investigated in fairly good depth, although perhaps there are not many non-trivial questions, or they were investigated more superficially. There is evidence of some further investigation as described above, but to a lesser extent, either in breadth or depth. Most results are pertinent, but there are perhaps a small number of results which are not as directly relevant, or not as helpful to answer the questions, or perhaps incorrect/inaccurate. There is some discussion of the questions but perhaps it could have been more extensive, or perhaps it is not always accurate or relevant.
- **3-6**: There are important issues with the investigation; perhaps there were only a small amount of work done (commensurate with group size); or questions were addressed only superficially/sequentially without much motivation or reflection on results; or questions were answered inappropriately, incorrectly, or not completely. There is little evidence of further investigation, perhaps at a basic level.
- **<3**: Little evidence of understanding of the task or of any serious investigation.

#### C3: 8 marks - Presentation and cohesion of the report

- **6-8:** The report is presented to a professional standard, pleasant to read, and forms a cohesive piece of work. Context, explanations, and discussion/conclusions are provided in Markdown cells with good formatting, to walk the reader through the investigation. All visualisations (tables, plots, maps, etc.) are clearly and accurately labelled, so that it is immediately clear what we are looking at. References are provided and presented appropriately wherever necessary.
- **3-5**: The report is relatively well presented, but perhaps there are some occasional issues, for example with text formatting, plot labelling, the display of output, or structure/sectioning of the report as a whole. There could be significant differences in the quality of presentation between sections of the report, which could indicate that very little proofreading and finalising of the report was done by the group.
- **<3**: Generally poor presentation; the report could look unfinished, or perhaps text is not formatted or there is very little text to explain/discuss the tasks. Perhaps the output (tables, plots, maps, etc.) is not displayed clearly or appropriately, which makes it difficult to interpret.

#### C4: 4 marks - Code comments, docstrings, code style and readability

All code should be appropriately commented. If functions were written, they should all have complete docstrings. The code should be easy to read, with consistent style and variable names chosen appropriately.
