    "When plotting functions you should ensure that you evaluate the function at a sufficient number of points (typically at least $100$). `plt.plot(x, y)` draws one point per element in `x` and `y` (coordinates (`x[0], y[0]`), (`x[1], y[1]`), etc.), and joins these points with straight lines; a line plot therefore only looks smooth if the grid of points is dense enough. Try replacing `1000` with `10` in the code cell above to see this.\n",

    "\n",
    "By default, if no plot exists, `plt.plot()` creates a *figure* window, and adds a set of *axes* to the figure. If a set of axes has already been created, when running `plt.plot()` a second time, the same axes are re-used, and the second plot is drawn over the first one. (This is true until you call `plt.show()`; further `plt.plot()` commands after a `plt.show()` will start another figure in your notebook.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Like everything in Python, figures and axes are **objects**. The `plt.subplots()` function can used to create a new figure object, along with one or more set(s) of axes inside it. The statement\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fig, ax = plt.subplots(m, n)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "creates a figure object, which we assign to the variable `fig`, and an **array** of axes, assigned to the variable `ax`, tiled in `m` rows and `n` columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we can select individual axes in the array, and use `.plot()` as before (this time, as a **method** of the `Axes` object). Try it:"

    "One of the buzzwords that you hear frequently in our time is \"data\". It is not an exaggeration to say “data” is changing the face of our world and it has becoming the capital of our era. Python is great at working with data and that is one of the reasons it has received so much love and attention in the last decade or so. There are many different types of data developed for different applications (texts, binaries, spreadsheets and so on), and there are also various ways to access data from a file, and to save the results to a file. Here we will discuss the basic way to open and read data from a **text** file. Later in the course, we will learn more about dealing with table-like data such as Excel files.\n",
