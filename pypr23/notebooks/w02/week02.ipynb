    "So far, we have seen object types consisting of essentially a single item of data. It is useful to have data types that can represent more than a single value -- for instance, in mathematics, we might want to represent a matrix or a vector. Python offers a number of different built-in object types to do this, called **containers** -- because they can contain other objects with different types. This week, we introduce **lists** as our first type of container.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have also seen that Python executes a set of commands from top to bottom, in the order in which you have scripted them. *Control flow* lets you decide *when*, *how many times*, or *under what condition(s)* to execute certain parts of your code, allowing you more control over the structure (or *flow*) of the code. This week, we also introduce our first control flow tools: **`for` loops** and **functions**.\n",
